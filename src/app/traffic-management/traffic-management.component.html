        <div class="col-sm-3">
            <h5><b>Traffic Signals and Signs:</b></h5>
            <p>Traffic signals and signs are essential tools for controlling the flow of traffic. Traffic lights
                regulate the movement of vehicles at intersections, while signs provide information, warnings, and
                directions to drivers and pedestrians.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-3">
            <h5><b>Lane Management:</b></h5>
            <p> Designating lanes for specific types of vehicles, such as carpool lanes or dedicated bus lanes, helps
                manage traffic flow and encourage carpooling and public transportation use.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-3">
            <h5><b> Speed Limits:</b></h5>
            <p> Establishing appropriate speed limits based on road conditions, urban or rural areas, and safety
                considerations helps prevent accidents and maintain a smooth traffic flow.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-3">
            <h5><b>Public Transportation: </b> </h5>
            <p>Efficient and reliable public transportation systems, including buses and trams, offer an
                alternative to private vehicle use, reducing congestion and environmental impact.</p>
